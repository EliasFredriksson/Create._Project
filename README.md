# Create. - A practise project to develop a website ordered from a customer.

This is a practise project for the development of a ordered website from a customer. I created the imaginery company "Create." for which I created their Graphical Profile. After that wireframes, mockups and the website. This was a fun learning experiene and I really enjoyed learning and messing around in Adobe Illustrator. Aswell as Photoshop and InDesign.

All assets is created from scratch inside Adobe Illustrator. Except for the fonts.

This project is mainly for practise in developing a website visually. So some functionallity is not implemented. For example the searchbar.
